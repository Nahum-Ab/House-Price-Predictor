# PRODIGY_ML_01

**Project Overview:**
    This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, the number of 
    bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the model aims to provide insights into the factors 
    influencing housing prices and demonstrate the application of linear regression in real-world scenarios.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains various features related to house characteristics and their corresponding sale prices.

**Key Features:**
    _GrLivArea_ (Above grade (ground) living area square feet),
    _BedroomAbvGr_ (Number of bedrooms above ground),
    _FullBath_ (Number of full bathrooms)

**Implementation:**
The project is structured as follows:
    _Data Preparation_: Load and preprocess the dataset, including feature selection and handling missing values.
    _Model Training_: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train a linear regression model on the training data.
    _Prediction_: Use the trained model to predict house prices on the test set.
    _Evaluation_: Assess the model's performance using MSE and visualize the results.

**Technologies Used:**
    [ _Python,
    Pandas,
    Scikit-learn,
    Matplotlib (for visualizations)_ ]
